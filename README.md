## What is CodeWars?

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online platform that offers a vast collection of coding challenges, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. It's a fantastic platform to practice coding, learn new algorithms, and improve problem-solving skills. The challenges are organized by kyu levels, with 8 kyu being the easiest and 1 kyu being the most challenging.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the kyu level of the CodeWars exercises. Each folder will contain:

- A well-structured and documented solution to the coding challenge.
- The problem statement for the exercise.
- If applicable, additional test cases to validate the solution's correctness.
